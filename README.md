# camera-to-ascii
INTRO

' this is an python script that will convert the input from your camera to ascii characters such as '@%#*+=-:. ' and yes the space is one of the chars'

# what is ascii?

ascii is the standerd chars that are in the following @ % # * + = - : .

# how to install?

if you are in windows 10/11 go to command prompt by going to the search bar on your task bar and type in 

```'CMD'```

then you will run the following commands,

```pip install opencv-python```

and then run

```pip install Pillow```

for the last two run

```pip install numpy && pip install imageio```

Note if an error shows up such as this
```pip not intsalled or not found``` you can go to this ```https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/pip-command-not-found``` NOTE: the website provided before is not mine it is just the best results I found to solve this error.

HAVE FUN, more will be added to the script but for now its open to use and mod, explained in thee License
